            <h4 id="electromagnetic-spectrum">Electromagnetic Spectrum</h4>
                Electromagnetic waves can be ordered based on wavelength and/or frequency.
                <br><br>
                <img src="/images/electromagneticspectrum.png" alt="electromagnetic spectrum" class="img-fluid">
                <span class="text-secondary">
                    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/light-waves/introduction-to-light-waves/a/light-and-the-electromagnetic-spectrum">(image source)</a>
                </span>
                <br><br>
                The lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength and vice versa. 
                It goes from radio (lowest) to gamma or y rays (highest). Visible light, the light we can see is
                only a very small section on the spectrum. Below the visible light are infrared, 
                microwaves and radio waves and above are UV/ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays. 
                Exposure to any waves would heat up your cells. 
                We experience waves such as radio and microwaves all the time such as using your phone and cooking and though you are 
                experiencing constant radiation, those waves aren't considered harmful. 
                High frequency/energy waves such as UV, x and gamma rays are harmful to your body. 
                Especially x rays
                and gamma rays can kill cells, as their energy these gamma ray photons carry can detach electrons in atoms. 
                This is called ionizing radiation and constant exposure can lead
                to deadly health conditions and as far as death.
                <br><br>
                <h4 id="radio-waves">Radio Waves</h4>
                Radio waves have an extremely large wavelength but low frequency. 
                Things like radio communication, broadcasting, satellites and wireless networks. Radio waves
                are created with an alternating current.
                <br><br>
                <h4 id="microwaves">Microwaves</h4>
                Microwaves are created by the back and forth movement of electrons in a vacuum.
                 Microwaves exist in most microwaves (the appliance), sattelites, TV, wireless 
                networks and more.
                <br><br>
                <h4 id="infrared">Infrared Waves</h4>
                Infrared radiation are created by the gain and loss of heat from atoms. 
                Things like night vision googles, hot objects, infrared lasers, optoelectronic devices 
                (OLED lights) and more.
                <br><br>
                <h4 id="visible-light">Visible Light</h4>
                Visible light is light we can see with our eyes. Colors we see are from frequencies from atoms. 
                The lowest frequency color is red while the highest is violet. If you
                look at the electromagnetic spectrum, you can see the colors are also arranged like a rainbow. 
                Rainbow colors can be formed from reflection, when an EM wave lands on 
                an object like a prism and it gets re-emitted.
                <br><br>
                <h4 id="ultraviolet-rays">Ultraviolet Rays</h4>
                Ultraviolet (UV) rays have a high frequency. 
                The most common way you would experience UV rays is from the sun. That is why you should put on some sunscreen
                to protect yourself. Though, most of the UV rays coming from the sun are blocked by earth's ozone layer.
                <br><br>
                <h4 id="x-rays">X Rays</h4>
                X-rays have even higher frequencies and the photons store enough energy to detach electrons from atoms. 
                It plays a big part in medicine. This is why when you are taking
                an x-ray, you wear a heavy shield around your body to protect your body that isn't being imaged.
                <br><br>
                <h4 id="gamma-rays">Gamma Rays</h4>
                Gamma rays, also known as y rays have the highest frequency and the lowest wavelength. 
                Gamma rays are released when a nucleus loses energy after a nuclear reaction.
                They are even more penetrating than x-rays. 
                There are a lot of gamma rays in space and the earth usually blocks most of these deadly rays. Gamma rays can also be 
                used to kill cancer cells; also known as radiation therapy or radiotherapy.
