            <h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
            In the modern world, electromagnetic radiation is all around you. Phones, internet, 
            satellites, microwaves, cooking, radios and other things you use produce
            electromagnetic waves. To show how connected these objects in you daily life are, if you have an old microwave, 
            it's on and you're standing close to it while you are using the internet, 
            you may experience a weaker internet connection. Well, after encountering this problem,
            I wondered why is that? It's because these waves you receive are the same electromagnetic waves. 
            The microwave, which was leaking radiation was interfering with
            your wifi connection, and both use the same frequency. 
            This problem can be solved by connecting to a 5GHz network which will give you a stronger connection but 
            will have less range. This is just one of the many ways you and other appliances experience electromagnetic radiation, 
            but what is electromagnetism anyways?
            <br><br>
            Electromagnetic Radiation is a field of study revolving around waves or photons of the electromagnetic field. 
            It consists of electromagnetic waves which are
            essentially oscillations (back and forth movement) of 2 fields, 
            electric field and the magnetic field, creating the electromagnetic field.
            <br><br>
            Electricity and magnetism was thought to be separate until in 1873, 
            James Clerk Maxwell developed a unified theory of electromagnetism. He found out when an 
            electric charge moved, it created a magnetic field.

            To create an electromagnetic wave, you can pass an alternating current through a wire. 
            It creates the wave because the physicist James Clerk Maxwell found out
            that the moving current was not the reason an electromagnetic field was created, 
            but he found out that a changing electric field created a magnetic field and a
            changing magnetic field created an electric field and these 2 fields would create an electromagnetic field. 
            He found out he could create a chain reaction that 
            will produce a wave of electric and magnetic fields and these fields were perpendicular to each other as shown here.

            <br><br>
            Additionally, the electromagnetic waves don't rely on a physical medium (no matter is needed) 
            in order to travel as it could able to travel through a vacuum 
            (space with no matter/low pressure). In fact, it was discovered that waves traveling in a 
            vacuum travel at the speed of light, which Maxwell concluded that light 
            itself is an electromagnetic wave.

            <br><br>
            As you can see, some properties of a wave include a wavelength (relates to frequency), 
            amplitude(the maximum extent of a vibration or oscillation)
            A wavelength is usually represented with a greek lambda (λ) with the unit being metres (m) 
            in an equation. The wave's frequency is the number of wavelengths 
            that pass a given space space per second. The unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz aka. ‎s^−1‎) 
            and is usually represented with a greek nu (looks like a v) or an f in an 
            equation. 
            <b>Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional so if wavelength increases by 5 then frequency will decrease to 
                1/5 of its initial value and vice versa.</b>
            <br><br>
            You can find wavelength or frequency using the equation: <br><br>
            <div class="text-center">
                <kbd class="h1">c = λv</kbd>
            </div>
            <br>
            <dl>
                <dt>c</dt>
                    <dd>is a constant <code> 3*10^8 </code>; 
                        the speed of light, also the approximate travel speed of an electromagnetic wave.</dd>
                <dt>λ</dt>
                    <dd>is the wavelength in metres (m) </dd>
                <dt>v</dt>
                    <dd>is the frequency in hertz (Hz) </dd>
            </dl>
            <br>
            If you have the value for either wavelength or frequency, you can find out the other value by using algebra. <br> 
            eg. <kbd>λ = c/v</kbd> to find wavelength
            <br><br>
            <h4 id="light-and-photons">Light and Photons</h4>
            Though Maxwell had concluded light was basically an electromagnetic wave, 
            there are some differences between light and radio waves. Unlike radio waves, light cannot be
            created by just changing a charge because you cannot change the charge quickly enough. 
            Light is produced by electrons in atoms and these electrons have different energy 
            levels and as the energy levels change, electromagnetic radiation is formed and depending on the frequency, 
            light is created.
            <br><br>
            A photon is an elementary particle (not thought to be made up of smaller particles), 
            it is a bundle of electromagnetic energy. Photons act as a carrier of 
            electromagnetic radiation. A scientist by the name of 
            Max Planck paved the way to the discovery of the photon when he discovered that electromagnetic radiation is quantized 
            (apply a quantum theory to minimized the amount of variables involved) 
            which proved that light has wavelike and particlelike properties. The concept of the photon
            was created by Albert Einstein.
            A way we interact with
            photons is with our eyes as we take its energy, convert it into electrical energy and send it to our brain to form an image. 
            Photons can be absorbed or 
            emitted by atoms. By being absorbed, the photon's energy is transferred and by being emitted, the atom loses energy. 
            The change in energy is proportional to the
            frequency.
            To calculate the energy, the equation is
            <br><br>
            <div class="text-center">
                <kbd class="h1">E = hv</kbd>
            </div>
            <br>
            <dl>
                <dt>E</dt>
                    <dd>is energy in joules (J)</dd>
                <dt>h</dt>
                    <dd>is Planck's Constant <code> 6.626*10^−34 Js </code> </dd>
                <dt>v</dt>
                    <dd>is the frequency in hertz (Hz or s^-1) </dd>
            </dl>
            <br>
            And if you have either <kbd>E</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd>, you can find the other value.
